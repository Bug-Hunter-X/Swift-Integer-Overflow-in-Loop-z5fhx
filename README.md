# Swift Integer Overflow Example

This repository demonstrates a simple example of integer overflow in Swift. The `bug.swift` file contains code that sums integers in a loop, potentially leading to an overflow if the loop iterates enough times. The `bugSolution.swift` file provides a solution using a larger integer type to prevent overflow.
